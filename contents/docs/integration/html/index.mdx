# Form Integration

The Form Integration section provides you with everything needed to embed your forms into websites, applications, or backend services. 4Form supports multiple integration methods to fit your technical requirements.

## Integration Methods

4Form provides ready-to-use code snippets for the following technologies:

- **HTML Form**: Traditional form submission
- **JavaScript/AJAX**: Asynchronous form submission
- **Python Requests**: Server-side integration
- **cURL Commands**: Command-line and script integration

## HTML Form Integration

### Basic HTML Implementation
The HTML integration provides a complete form snippet that you can embed directly into any website:

```html
<form action="https://your-form-url.com/submit" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required>
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required>
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

**Benefits:**
- Works on any website without JavaScript
- Traditional form submission with page reload
- Compatible with all browsers
- Simple to implement

## JavaScript/AJAX Integration

### Asynchronous Form Submission
For modern web applications that require seamless user experience:

```javascript
async function submitForm(formData) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://your-form-url.com/submit', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData)
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('Form submitted successfully');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Submission failed:', error);
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No page reload required
- Better user experience
- Real-time validation possible
- Custom success/error handling

## Python Integration

### Server-Side Form Submission
Perfect for backend services, automation scripts, or data processing:

```python
import requests

def submit_form_data(data):
    url = "https://your-form-url.com/submit"
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Form submitted successfully")
    else:
        print(f"Submission failed: {response.status_code}")

# Example usage
form_data = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "message": "Hello from Python!"
}
submit_form_data(form_data)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Automated data collection
- Backend service integration
- Batch form submissions
- Data migration scripts

## cURL Integration

### Command-Line Form Submission
Ideal for testing, shell scripts, and automation:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-form-url.com/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "message": "Hello from cURL!"
  }'
```

**Use Cases:**
- API testing
- Shell script automation
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Quick form testing

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Get Your Form URL
Each form has a unique submission URL that you'll find in the Integration section of your form settings.

### 2. Choose Your Method
Select the integration method that best fits your technical stack and requirements.

### 3. Copy the Code
All code snippets are pre-configured with your form's unique URL. Simply copy and paste into your project.

### 4. Customize as Needed
Modify the code to match your styling, validation requirements, and error handling preferences.

### 5. Test Your Integration
Always test your form integration before going live to ensure proper data submission.

## Best Practices

- **Always validate data** on both client and server side
- **Handle errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages
- **Test thoroughly** across different browsers and devices
- **Use HTTPS** for secure data transmission
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent spam submissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **CORS errors**: Ensure your domain is whitelisted in form settings
- **Failed submissions**: Check network connectivity and form URL
- **Missing data**: Verify field names match your form configuration
- **Timeout errors**: Consider implementing retry logic for network issues
