1. **What can I do from the Form Integration section?**

   From the Form Integration section, you can easily integrate your form into any website, application, or service. This page provides ready-to-use code and instructions for several popular technologies, making it simple to collect submissions directly from your own platform.

2. **Which technologies are supported for form integration?**

   You can connect your form using the following methods:
   - HTML Form
   - JavaScript/AJAX
   - Python Request

6. **Is there support for sending form data with cURL?**

   Absolutely! You’ll get a cURL command ready to copy and run. This is especially useful for testing or integrating form submissions within bash scripts or other command-line tools.

7. **Where do I find all these code samples?**

   All code samples are conveniently displayed on the Form Integration page, each pre-filled with your form’s unique submission URL. You can copy any snippet to integrate the form quickly using your preferred technology.

8. **Why use these integration methods?**

   These technologies cover a wide range of use cases—from simple HTML websites to advanced web applications, backend services, and automation scripts. This flexibility ensures your form can collect responses wherever you need, using the stack you prefer.
